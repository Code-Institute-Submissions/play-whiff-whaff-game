## How was the project's validation process conducted?
**The following tools have been used to check project's validation:**

* [**W3C Markup validation**](https://validator.w3.org/)

* [**W3C CSS Validation**](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

3. **Testing:** 

    3.1 **User stories**

    **Userâ€™s expectations:**

    * As a new user, I am hoping to have an easy access to website's content

        - the user can smoothly navigate through website and find what is looking for;
        - the user will not feel overwhelmed with a volume of the information as it was the designer's 
        intention to keep the text content to minimum

    * As a new user, I am hoping to enjoy the game
        - the simplicity of the game will be its value as there is no complicated set of game rules which 
        could make the player confused

    * As a new user, I want to connect with the website host using the available social-media links;
        - the available social-media links are active and once an icon is clicked/tapped it will take the user 
        to the external websites where the information about the website's host can be found


## Additional Testing 
I have asked my family members, friends and fellow Code Institute students to test and review my website. I was 
adviced the game could have a leaderboard with the best scorer, number of wins and defeats. This idea would be included 
in **Features to be implemented in the future** paragraph in [**README.md**](https://github.com/KrisK1978/play-whiff-whaff-game/blob/master/README.md) file.
