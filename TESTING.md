## Testing

During planning my project I knew a quality testing plan had to be prepared. Creating this plan began with having 
a clear purpose and vision in mind. I had to ask myself how to fulfil the user's expectations and what needed to be 
done to accomplish my stated goal. I had to scrutinise each line of my code to make sure everything was working properly.
Thanks to the wireframes I created I was able to pick a selected feature and conduct a test which provided a clear outcome.
These individual tests confirmed the selected elements had been implemented correctly. I also used widely known and popular
validation services to check the project's content. The following tools were used to confirm its validation:

* [**W3C Markup validation**](https://validator.w3.org/) - to make sure I created a valid HTML code.

* [**W3C CSS Validation**](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - to validate my CSS style sheet embedded in my HTML document.

* [**JS Hint**](https://jshint.com/) - to detect errors and potential problems in my JavaScript code.


I knew my project needed to be fully responsive but I was aware it can be difficult to achieve that using a canvas element. 
I decided to take a slightly different approach and inform the user that the game functionality can be fully achieved using
devices with higher resolution i.e. laptops/desktops. This is also because I used **mousemove** event to control player's 
moves which works efficiently on these devices. 


### User Stories

#### Userâ€™s expectations:

* As a new user, I am hoping to have an easy access to website's content

    - the user can smoothly navigate through website and find what is looking for;
    - the user will not feel overwhelmed with a volume of the information as it was the designer's 
    intention to keep the text content to minimum

* As a new user, I am hoping to enjoy the game
    - the simplicity of the game will be its biggest value as there is no complicated set of game rules which 
    could make the player confused

* As a new user, I want to connect with the website host using the available social-media links;
    - the available social-media links are active and once an icon is clicked/tapped it will take the user 
    to the external websites where the information about the website's host can be found

#### User's Testing Stories 



**Additional Testing**
I have asked my family members, friends and fellow Code Institute students to test and review my website. I was 
adviced the game could have a leaderboard with the best scorer, number of wins and defeats. This idea would be included 
in **Features to be implemented in the future** paragraph in [**README.md**](https://github.com/KrisK1978/play-whiff-whaff-game/blob/master/README.md) file.
