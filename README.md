**Ping - Pong** also known as **Whiff-Whaff** is a table tennis game where two or four players hit a lightweight ball back an forth across a table divided with a net. Players use small rackets and must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table. They must hit it back to the opposite side. The point is scored when the player fails to return the ball. It seems to be an easy game, but **Ping-Pong** is considered as a fast-paced challenge and requires quick reactions.
