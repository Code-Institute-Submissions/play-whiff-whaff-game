**Ping - Pong** also known as **Whiff-Whaff** is a table tennis game where two or four players hit a lightweight ball back an forth across a table divided with a net. Players use small rackets and must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table. They must hit it back to the opposite side. The point is scored when the player fails to return the ball. It seems to be an easy game, but **Ping-Pong** is considered as a fast-paced challenge and requires quick reactions.

## UX

### Project goal 
The main purpose for creating this website was to deliver a game which will be fun to play at every age. This could be a demanding task nowadays, especially
when we have an unlimited access to the digital world of sophisticated  and graphically involved games. Although *Whiff-Whaff* can be considered as very basic 
and not complicated, however, it does not mean that simplicity can boring. Playing this game demands swift reactions and even though it seems to be an easy task 
to do, the play itself can be a relatively competitive challenge. My main aim and foremost priority was to give the users some good time. 

### Designer's strategy
* to design a basic but enjoyable game for a wide range of users at any age;

* to apply minimal text, the website user is not overwhelmed with the content and simply not lose interest;

### Design elements
*   *background*
    * applied vidid colors to the project elements to make it *'eye-catching'*
            
        * **body**                              
            <img src="assets/images/colors/body.png">
        * **canvas** 
            <img src="assets/images/colors/canvas.png">


*   *fonts*
    * a single-type of font has been used to keep the text consistent through the website content
